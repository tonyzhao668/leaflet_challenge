* Thank you for review and comments.

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

Done!

1. Get the past 7 dates' earthquake data set from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

2. Import & Visualize the Data

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Showing magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

Done! 
    * Tectonic_plates data from <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>;
    * For the base maps with 4 layer options i.e. street, satellite, light and dark;
    * For the overlay, there is two options, i.e. earthquake and tectonic_plates;
    * With Standarde layer controls.
    * Except the bottomright legend for the multi_layers' not achieved.
